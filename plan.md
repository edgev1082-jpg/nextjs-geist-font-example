Below is a detailed plan using proper markdown formatting that outlines every step, dependent file, and best practice for building a “Casa Rockera” page within your Next.js project.

---

## 1. Overview

We will build a dedicated page (route at "/casa-rockera") that showcases a modern, edgy house designed for rockers. The page will include a hero section with a background image, feature sections with descriptive cards, a gallery carousel, and a contact form for inquiries. Styling will use Tailwind (via globals.css) and the existing UI components from the src/components/ui folder. All images will use placeholder image URLs with descriptive text, proper alt texts, and an onerror fallback.

## 2. Dependent Files

Before proceeding, note these files and components that will be referenced:

- **New Page File:**  
  - `src/app/casa-rockera/page.tsx` (to be created)

- **UI Components (existing):**  
  - `src/components/ui/card.tsx` (for feature cards)  
  - `src/components/ui/carousel.tsx` (for gallery display)  
  - `src/components/ui/button.tsx` (for the contact form submission button)  
  - `src/components/ui/input.tsx` and `src/components/ui/form.tsx` (for the contact form)  

- **Styling:**  
  - `src/app/globals.css` (global CSS and Tailwind setup)  

*If any of these files are missing or require an update (e.g., adding conditional styling for a dark, rock vibe), read them first and adjust accordingly.*

## 3. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Step 3.1 – Create the New Page File
- **File:** `src/app/casa-rockera/page.tsx`  
- **Changes:**
  - Import necessary dependencies (React, useState for managing form state, and UI components).
  - Use a functional component to render the entire page.
  - Ensure proper error handling for image loading (using onerror).

### Step 3.2 – Build the Header and Hero Section
- **Header:**  
  - Display a prominent page title (e.g., “Casa Rockera”).
  - Use a full-width container with dark background and neon-accent text.
- **Hero Section:**  
  - Add an `<img>` tag with a placeholder URL:  
    ```tsx
    const heroImage = "https://placehold.co/1920x1080?text=Modern+rocker+house+exterior+featuring+graffiti+neon+lights+and+industrial+architecture";
    ```
  - Set the `alt` attribute to a descriptive text such as: “Imagen placeholder representando la fachada de una casa rockera con graffiti, luces de neón y arquitectura industrial.”
  - Add an `onError` handler that falls back to a secondary placeholder (e.g., a smaller size image with “Image+Not+Available”).

### Step 3.3 – Develop the Features Section
- **Using Card Component:**  
  - Create multiple cards (one for each feature) that represent:
    - Sala de ensayo
    - Estudio musical
    - Área del bar temático
    - Espacios de descanso con toques industriales  
  - Each card should include:
    - Title (e.g., “Sala de Ensayo”)
    - Description text
    - Optionally, a smaller placeholder image with fallback handling.
  - Use Tailwind classes for margins, padding, and hover effects.

### Step 3.4 – Implement the Gallery Carousel
- **Using Carousel Component:**  
  - Display several placeholder images (similar to the hero image but in a smaller format) that show different angles and rooms.
  - Each slide image URL example:
    ```tsx
    const galleryImage = "https://placehold.co/800x600?text=Interior+shot+of+rocker+living+room+with+vintage+guitars+and+neon+accents";
    ```
  - Ensure images have descriptive alt texts and onerror fallbacks.

### Step 3.5 – Design the Contact Form Section
- **Using Form and Input Components:**  
  - Build a simple form for visitor inquiries with these fields:
    - Nombre
    - Email
    - Mensaje  
  - Use the button component for the “Enviar Consulta” action.
- **Form Validation and Error Handling:**
  - Add basic client-side validations (e.g., required fields).
  - Provide error messages (using a state variable) if inputs are empty upon submission.
  - Log submission data to the console (or place a placeholder for future integration with an API).

### Step 3.6 – UI/UX and Styling Considerations
- **Overall Design:**
  - Use a dark theme with neon accent colors for headings and buttons.
  - Apply ample spacing and modern typography for readability.
  - Use Tailwind classes to ensure responsive layouts and consistency across devices.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Each image should contain descriptive alt text.
  - Use semantic HTML (e.g., `<section>`, `<header>`, `<main>`).
  - Ensure form elements include associated labels for better accessibility.

### Step 3.7 – Testing and Validation
- **Local Testing:**  
  - Run the development server (using `npm run dev` or similar).
  - Navigate to `/casa-rockera` and verify:
    - Correct image loading with fallback handling.
    - Functional form with validations.
    - Responsive layout of the hero, features, gallery, and contact form.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Intentionally break an image URL to validate the onerror behavior.
  - Test form submission with empty inputs to ensure error messages are shown.

## 4. Summary

- Created a new page at `src/app/casa-rockera/page.tsx` to showcase a modern “Casa Rockera” with a dark, rock-inspired aesthetic.
- Implemented a hero section using a placeholder image with detailed descriptive text, including error handling via onerror fallback.
- Integrated feature cards using the existing Card component to detail spaces like the sala de ensayo and estudio musical.
- Developed a gallery carousel and a contact form that uses existing UI components with client-side validation.
- Ensured modern, responsive UI/UX using Tailwind styling, semantic HTML, and accessibility best practices.
- Tested error handling for images and form validations.
- The plan leverages existing components and global styling while preparing for future API integration.
